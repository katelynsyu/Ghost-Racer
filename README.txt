This is Project 3 from my CS 32 class (Winter 2021).

Ghost Racer is set int he year 2022 in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Zombies roam around unhindered, and have even learned how to drive taxi cabs (better than most Los Angeles taxi drivers, but not better than Lyft drivers). The few humans that are left wander aimlessly around searching for long lost friends. And the souls of the recently deceased have for some strange reason convened on the 405 freeway, waiting for someone to free them to be sent to the afterlife. Our hero is Aisha Washington, a recently-certified zombie hunter, amateur Formula 1 driver, and former Google Principal Engineer (the world has no need for Google anymore). Aisha must drive her Ghost Racer (a modified Subaru Forester, like Prof. Nachenberg drives) north on the 405 freeway, freeing trapped souls so they can go to the afterlife. While doing so, Aisha has to dodge wandering human pedestrians (hitting a human ped instantly ends the level), shoot zombies with holy water, run zombie cabs off the road, and avoid dangerous oil slicks (which cause Aishaâ€™s Ghost Racer to slip and slide). Aisha can also pick up goodies like healing kits and holy water recharges that she finds on the road to help in her quest. Once Aisha has freed all of the souls from the current stretch of the 405, she advances to the next, more infested stretch of the freeway, where she continues the good fight. The 405 goes on and on, so Aisha will be busy for a long time.

To run GhostRacer:

1. Locate the folder GhostRacer, which should have in it files named
GhostRacer and Assets.  It's likely that the path to the folder will be
/Users/yourname/GhostRacer or /Users/yourname/Downloads/GhostRacer.

2. Open a Terminal window and type
        cd whateverThePathIs
where you should replace whateverThePathIs with the path to the GhostRacer
folder.

3. Confirm you're in the right folder by typing
        ls
which should show you the Assets folder and the GhostRacer executable.

4. Type
        ./GhostRacer
to play the game.

Alternatively, in the folder GhostRacer, you can move the Assets folder
to your home directory, then double-click on the GhostRacer executable
file.
